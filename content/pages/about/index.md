I am Yoo Young Lee, Head, Metadata and Processing at the University of Ottawa Library in Canada. This professional blog is my space to share insights on topics I am passionate about and document my journey of learning and growth.

I deeply value <b>openness, kindness,</b> and <b>connectedness</b>. As a lifelong learner, I continually seek to enhance my skills and expand my knowledge to make information, data, and tools more open and accessible. I believe kindness is essential to our shared humanity and emphasize the importance of relationships and collaboration in everything I do.

Before joining the uOttawa Library, I began my career at Indiana University - Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) as a Digital User Experience Librarian and IT Analyst Developer. It was there that I embraced the value of "openness" in all its dimensions, shaping the foundation of my professional philosophy.
