On the second weekend of September, I re-read an essay, *Novelist as a profession*, written by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haruki_Murakami">Murakami Haruki</a>, translated to Korean to stop my addiction to watching a series of old soap operas on YouTube. I grew up reading his novels (i.e., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kafka_on_the_Shore">Kafka on the Shore</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_Wood_(novel)">Norwegian Wood</a>), but actually prefer his essays more than his novels: very witty, easy to read through, yet thoughtful.

His essay talks about him as a novelist - who are novelists (their common characteristics), how he writes a novel, what to write, what needed for novelists to continue to write and etc. Obviously, I am not a writer, but his essay made me to reflect upon my recent writing experience as non-native speaker.

To be honest, writing is very stressful and sometimes frustrating for me and I thought that this was all because I wrote as non-native speaker. I knew that there are people who compose well in their non mother tongue, but unfortunately, I am not one of them. Realistically, I won't be a good writer either with English or French ever in my life even though I practice a lot to write. However, I've also learned through school and career that there are ways to improve little by little.

Recently, I had to complete three different writings and just realized how much I have enhanced my writing skills (my writing is not that great but nevertheless important improvement). I still remembered my first writing in English. The way I did was I wrote first in Korean and asked <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naver_(corporation)">Naver</a> (sort of Korean version of Google) again in Korean like "how to say xxx in English." Although my English sentences could be simple, I don't follow this practice anymore and I can actually write something in English without translation.

I was curious how this could happen.  


Librarianship doesn't ask me to write well like novelist or journalist, but it requires me to write quite a lot and communicate clearly in the writing formats: internal reports, grant applications, statements of interest, scholarly articles, just to name a few.
